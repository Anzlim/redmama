Don’t want to get into details of documentation of this service. And wanted to have a look around appsync without actually understanding it completely.\nThis Guide has no intention of making the reader capable of working on this service asap.\nBut to Help get understand the Applications of this service. Getting Familiar with the service. And Exploring various possible ways of using the AppSync Service.\nGetting the fundamentals clear Appsync is one of the best services provided by AWS for building small to medium size backend. It covers almost all the parts to build an end to end backend.\nSo what really is Appsync? We can have more than one definition based on our requirements. If we wanted to use it for filling the need of an api then it’s a perfect alternative to API gateway. Or if we wanted some logic, then it provides computation using resolvers, more details on resolvers later.\nOr if you wanted to use Graph QL api then this is the best managed graph QL engine.\nFor me I had chosen appsync for realtime architecture needs. Yes it supports real time data transfer with basic filtering. You can connect to other services of AWS as well as any service in the world using http resolver.\nIn a nutshell appsync is a managed graph QL engine with many features like authentication, realtime data (wss - websocket) support \u0026 a little bit of computation built-in using VTL (Velocity template language) language in resolver.\nWho should Consider Appsync  If you want to build a real time application for example a chat application. If you are good at graph QL \u0026 wanted to use Graph QL api in your project If your project is not too complex or big If you wanted to use AWS service only If you wanted to build something is less time  Who should not care about appsync  If your project is too complex If you don’t need real time capability in your application If rest api fulfills your requirements  Graph QL Before understanding graph ql let’s take a look at how clients used to communicate with the server earlier. For a client to communicate with the server an API is required, the most popular is the rest api. Which is widely used in big projects. Before rest there was COBRA \u0026 Soap.\nWe don’t need to understand there working nor there history but if you wanted to have a read on this do check the Article - History of rest api\nGraph QL was publicly released in 2015. It is the newest API to work with.\nDo watch this Graph QL - Documentary\nThat’s it with history. Let’s understand the technology.\nLet’s take an example : There are a bunch of attributes and a structure that you wanted to call. Let’s say user data, \u0026 You also wanted a list of hobbies of that user.\nSo if a rest api is implemented then you need to call two times one for getting the user and another for getting it’s hobbies (Depends upon how the api is implemented)\nThe rest api is simple. Performs just one task. Though this may come at an extra api call.\nOn the other hand in Graph QL you could do just one call to get both the data, that is the user \u0026 it’s hobbies. In Graph QL you get what you want there is no under-fetching or over-fetching\nunder-fetching - when you do an API call but the data you got is not enough for your need then it’s under-fetching.\nover-fetching - when you do an API call and you get more data than is required then it’s over fetching.\nTo get these advantages it all depends on how you make your Schema design. Don’t worry if you have not understood. It takes a good amount of time to learn to make a good schema.\nWell what is a schema?\nIt’s one of the most important parts of graph QL. It defines the data type of the object. The shape of the object that could be passed. Also it lets us define mutation query \u0026 subscriptions.\nMutations - It can be considered as an alternative to put, post \u0026 delete request of rest api. Basically this is used to Manipulate The data on the server.\nQuery - this is an alternative to get requests of rest api. If you want to get a particular data from a server use a Query request.\nSubscriptions - This is an awesome feature which lets you do some real time stuff. Example if you wanted to build a chat system with getting new messages in real time.\nLet’s understand the Syntax of the schema\nThe schema is what decides the shape of the data which is to be passed between the client \u0026 the server.\nIf you know DTO’s (Data transfer Object) then it is a bit easy to get started with schema design.\nExample : Creating a user data, and getting a user data\ntype user { id : String name : String age: Int } As we discussed the different operations available in Graph QL. Let’s take a look at the Query first.\ntype Query { getUsers : [user] } So we are creating a query getUsers and defining the return type which is an array of already defined type user. Simple right. Now let’s make a mutation for adding a user\ntype Mutations { addUser(id:String,name: String,age:Int): user } Here we are passing arguments to the mutation addUser. It’s like calling a function with some parameters \u0026 getting a return value. We will discuss Subscription later.\nThis was really a short description of Schema. Because this guide is not really for Graph QL but for AWS Appsync service. But don’t worry as we will progress we will cover schema design again.\nSo let’s hold tight and move forward.\nGuide on GraphQl - Graph QL Docs\n Elements of Appsync   Data Source   Schema   Resolver   Authentication   Functions (optional)   Data Source The data Source decides the data Source. The name itself is Descriptive.\nSay we want to store data in DynamoDB we can use DynamoDB as our data source and connect through a mutation in the schema.\nSchema We create Schema to shape as well as define operations.\nAn addUser mutation can be used to add a user or getUser to get a user. A Type User which defines that it contains attributes like Id, name, age with type String, String \u0026 Int respectively.\nResolver The Resolver is where all the Business logic is done.\nThe appsync provides VTL ( Velocity template language ) as an option to write our custom logic.\nWe need to attach a data Source to a Resolver.\nThe data source can be DynamoDB or Lambda Function and many other options are available. We define addUser mutation then connect it with a Resolver which then could perform the required operations.\nAuthentication The Appsync provides many authentication types like api key, AWS cognito, IAM etc.\nWe will take a look at authentication methods provided, understanding their pros \u0026 cons.\nFunctions Function in appsync is like a unit of computation which can be used multiple times. Like we use in any other programming language.\nThese are the main parts. Let’s look at them one at a time and how they are connected to each other.\nWhat is a Resolver Resolver is one of the most important part in Appsync.\nand even more important if you are thinking of adding most of the business logic in the resolver. Let’s get Started.\nFirst we need to create a data Source. We will create a DynamoDB data source. We need to use VTL ( Velocity template language ) in which we add our business logic.\nWhat is VTL ?\nApache Velocity Template Language (VTL) is a Java-based template engine.\nVTL is a logical template language that gives you the power to manipulate both the request and the response in the standard request/response flow of a web application.\nIt is very similar to any other language. It has variables, conditional statements, loops and many data types supported.\nI will guide with basic stuff only. But for getting a deeper understanding please refer to the AWS guide.\nVariables #set(variable_name = \"Value\") Arrays #set(Arr = []) To add element\nArr.add(\"first element\") Conditional checks #if(condition) ##Logic to be performed #else ##other logic to be performed #end Notice the #end it’s compulsory\nLoops #foreach(var in Arr) ##desired operations #end Don’t worry if you haven’t understood. Because it’s not meant to be.\nThis is to get an overview and nothing more than that.\nVTL is good for achieving easy - medium business logic not at all recommended for hard \u0026 complex logic ( My personal experience)\nConcept Here we go, A resolver connects the schema with the Back-end. We can write CRUD operations in resolver.\nSuppose I want to write add user Operation in DynamoDB The request mapping template is\n{ \"version\" : \"2018-05-29\", \"operation\" : \"PutItem\", \"key\": { \"name\" : $util.dynamodb.toDynamoDBJson($ctx.args.email), \"age\" : $util.dynamodb.toDynamoDBJson($ctx.args.age) }, \"attributeValues\" : { \"address\" : $util.dynamodb.toDynamoDBJson($ctx.args.address) } } If you don’t know DynamoDB - It’s a superfast Nosql database from AWS. Where you create a table and store objects in it.\nIt has concept of primary key \u0026 sort key Both these are attributes.\nLike to store user data the table would be like\n email - Primary key attribute name - Sort key attribute age - regular attribute address - regular attribute  The condition is that in every item it should have a unique combination of primary key \u0026 Sort key in a particular table.\nIn this case no two items can have same email as well as name (This is just an example as email will always be unique anyway)\nAn item should compulsorily have a primary key and can have any other attributes. (Upto 100 attributes) Now if you check resolver above It has some fields\nversion - The version for template definition\nOperation - the DynamoDB operations (In our case a PutItem to add new item) Key - which allow us to add the the primary \u0026 sort key value\nattributeValues : These are the extra attributes which could be added\nNow the Response mapping template could be\n$utils.toJson($context.result) Just passing the result back to the client as is.\nIf you didn’t understand the technicality, no worry because it was not meant to be.\nAll you should get by now is how Appsync works in basic terms. The Resolver is a very important \u0026 very big part and we will dive deeper in some other guides.\nBasic Authentication The Appsync provides many authentication methods Mainly IAM, AWS Cognito, API_KEY and others.\nAPI_KEY The aws console allows us to create a temp api key which can have a validity of upto a year.\nSo this could be where you use your graph QL api as a third party api elsewhere. It’s not recommended for regular projects though. Can be used for testing purpose\nIAM If you know about AWS IAM and it’s concepts like temporary roles, and you are good at it.\nThen you should consider this authentication type otherwise staying away at the beginning is good.\nAWS Cognito This is the recommended authentication type to use in Appsync. You need to connect a user pool to appsync.\nThe biggest benefit is that you get the identity object which have user attributes which can be used for fine grained Authorization.\nYou can connect with me for any query or discussion on LinkedIn or Twitter\n","wordCount":"1935","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2021-11-01T19:17:56+05:30","dateModified":"2021-11-01T19:17:56+05:30","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Red"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://redmama.me/posts/getting-started-with-appsync/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Red's Blog","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://redmama.me/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>if(localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"){document.body.classList.add('dark');}else if(localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"){document.body.classList.remove('dark')}else if(window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)').matches){document.body.classList.add('dark');}</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://redmama.me/ accesskey=h title="Red's Blog (Alt + H)">Red's Blog</a>

</code></pre><p>Don&rsquo;t worry if you haven&rsquo;t understood. Because it&rsquo;s not meant to be.<br>This is to get an overview and nothing more than that.</p><p>VTL is good for achieving easy - medium business logic not at all recommended for hard & complex logic ( My personal experience)</p><h3 id=concept>Concept<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#concept>#</a></h3><p>Here we go, A resolver connects the schema with the Back-end.
We can write CRUD operations in resolver.<br>Suppose I want to write add user Operation in DynamoDB
The request mapping template is</p><pre><code class=language-velocity data-lang=velocity>{
&quot;version&quot; : &quot;2018-05-29&quot;,
&quot;operation&quot; : &quot;PutItem&quot;,
&quot;key&quot;: {
&quot;name&quot; : $util.dynamodb.toDynamoDBJson($ctx.args.email),
&quot;age&quot; : $util.dynamodb.toDynamoDBJson($ctx.args.age)
},
&quot;attributeValues&quot; : {
&quot;address&quot; : $util.dynamodb.toDynamoDBJson($ctx.args.address) }
}
</code></pre><p>If you don&rsquo;t know DynamoDB - It&rsquo;s a superfast Nosql database from AWS. Where you create a table and store objects in it.<br>It has concept of primary key & sort key
Both these are attributes.<br>Like to store user data the table would be like</p><ul><li><em><strong>email - Primary key attribute</strong></em></li><li><em><strong>name - Sort key attribute</strong></em></li><li><em><strong>age - regular attribute</strong></em></li><li><em><strong>address - regular attribute</strong></em></li></ul><p>The condition is that in every item it should have a unique combination of primary key & Sort key in a particular table.<br>In this case no two items can have same email as well as name (This is just an example as
email will always be unique anyway)</p><p>An item should compulsorily have a primary key and can have any other attributes. (Upto 100 attributes)
Now if you check resolver above
It has some fields</p><p><strong>version</strong> - The version for template definition<br><strong>Operation</strong> - the DynamoDB operations (In our case a PutItem to add new item)
<strong>Key</strong> - which allow us to add the the primary & sort key value<br><strong>attributeValues</strong> : These are the extra attributes which could be added</p><p>Now the Response mapping template could be</p><pre><code class=language-velocity data-lang=velocity>$utils.toJson($context.result)
</code></pre><p>Just passing the result back to the client as is.</p><p>If you didn&rsquo;t understand the technicality, no worry because it was not meant to be.<br>All you should get by now is how Appsync works in basic terms. The Resolver is a very important & very big part and we will dive deeper in some other guides.</p><h2 id=basic-authentication>Basic Authentication<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#basic-authentication>#</a></h2><p>The Appsync provides many authentication methods
Mainly IAM, AWS Cognito, API_KEY and others.</p><h3 id=api_key>API_KEY<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#api_key>#</a></h3><p>The aws console allows us to create a temp api key which can have a validity of upto a year.<br>So this could be where you use your graph QL api as a third party api elsewhere. It&rsquo;s not recommended for regular projects though. Can be used for testing purpose</p><h3 id=iam>IAM<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#iam>#</a></h3><p>If you know about AWS IAM and it&rsquo;s concepts like temporary roles, and you are good at it.<br>Then you should consider this authentication type otherwise staying away at the beginning is good.</p><h3 id=aws-cognito>AWS Cognito<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#aws-cognito>#</a></h3><p>This is the recommended authentication type to use in Appsync. You need to connect a user pool to appsync.<br>The biggest benefit is that you get the identity object which have user attributes which
can be used for fine grained Authorization.</p><p>You can connect with me for any query or discussion on <a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/mohd-anzar-a29b13184/>LinkedIn</a> or <a
